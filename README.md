# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
Forked over the starter code due to lack of time to build my own from scratch.

## Steps
1- Installed all packages and tested them

2- Added GET and POST routes to handle the incoming data

3- Created an account on OpenWeatherMap website to get my own API key and created fetch function to get data

4- Made async function to proper add the API data

5- Another promise to upDate the UI
